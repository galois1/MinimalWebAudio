Attention:

You need to run this example under a HTTP server, such as an Apache server.

Mac/Linux users, youc an easily do the following:

- sudo apachectl start
- add these two files in your preferred directory, or add them under 
```
/Library/WebServer/Documents
```
(which is the default directory for Apache in Mac)
- sudo chmod 777 liszt.mp3 (you need to give permission to this file)
- access localhos/liszt.html
- Play the song and enjoy Liszt!
